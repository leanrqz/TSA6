        <p>Hi! Welcome to BarbieTech! <br><br> We’re your go-to team for basic cybersecurity and IT solutions, 
          especially built for small businesses looking to protect what matters most—their data, their website, 
          and their peace of mind. <br><br>
          
          At BarbieTech, we believe that cybersecurity doesn’t have to be complicated or intimidating. 
          Our mission is to make digital protection accessible, understandable, and affordable for entrepreneurs, 
          creatives, and startups who want to thrive safely in the online world.</p>

  <h1 class="about-title"><br>Inspiration for BarbieTech!</h1><br>
  <div class="boxed-section">
    <div class="about-wrapper">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>BarbieTech was inspired by none other than the ultimate icon of confidence, versatility, and empowerment — Barbie herself. 
          She’s been everything from an astronaut to a CEO, so we thought, why not a cybersecurity queen too?<br><br>
          We saw a gap in the tech world — especially for small businesses — where cybersecurity felt cold, complicated, 
          and dominated by corporate tech bros. So we built BarbieTech to change that: a space where technology is powerful, protective, and unapologetically pink.<br><br>
          Barbie taught us that you can be stylish and smart, fierce and friendly, professional and playful. That’s exactly what we bring to our clients — basic cybersecurity and 
          IT services served with clarity, compassion, and a whole lot of confidence.
          Because at BarbieTech, we believe you don’t have to change who you are to take control of your tech. You just need the right team — and maybe a pink laptop.</p>
